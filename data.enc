It seems google\nlikes to change things. I saw the following for the class value &quot;a3s aiL msg8020329143194333462&quot;.\nSo I tried the following: &quot;content_loc = &quot;//div[contains(@class, 'a3s aiL')]&quot;&quot; which is working\n(as of now).</p>\n<h2>Better Return Value:</h2>\n<p>For 'grab_otp=True' the complete mail message is returned. The caller has then to extract the OTP.\nIt would be better to just retrieve the OTP like in the old implementation with\n&quot;verification_code = re.findall(r'(\\d{6})', mail_content)&quot;</p>\n<h2>Improve Inbox Handling:</h2>\n<p>It can happen easily that there are several emails with the same subject in the inbox (especially\nduring testing). In that case the oldest mail is selected and delivers the wrong OTP. It would be\ngood to have the mails sorted, so that always the newest one is read.</p>\n<h2>Second Login:</h2>\n<p>If you stay in the same test case the following sequence is currently not working.\nAfter successful gmail login and logout and closing the tab, the next time you open gmail,\nin a new tab for login, gmail redirects you to a page to register a new account.\nThis window needs to be handled (closed), to reach the authentification window as expected.</p>\n"}]}
